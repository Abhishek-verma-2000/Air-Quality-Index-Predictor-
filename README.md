# Air-Quality-Index-Predictor-

## Overview
This project aims to build an Air Quality Index (AQI) Predictor using machine learning models. The dataset used contains AQI information for Bangalore city, collected from the years 2013-2018. The data was sourced from tutiempo.net, a platform that provides historical weather data.

## Project Phases
Data Analysis: Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns, trends, and outliers in the AQI data.
Feature Engineering: Create and select meaningful features from the dataset that will enhance the performance of the machine learning models.
Model Building: Implement various machine learning algorithms to predict the AQI and evaluate their performance using metrics such as RMSE, MAE, etc.

## Timeline
Data Analysis: Identify and clean any anomalies in the data. Visualize trends over time.
Feature Engineering: Create new features, handle missing data, and encode categorical variables.
Model Building & Prediction: Build and test multiple models to predict AQI, selecting the best-performing model for future use.
